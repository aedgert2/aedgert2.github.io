            <h3>Website Evaluation</h3>
            
            <h4>Technical Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>File Naming:</strong> All file names follow proper naming conventions with lowercase letters and no spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Page Structure:</strong> The site includes all required structural elements: header, main, footer, and nav.</li>
                <li><strong>Header Element:</strong> The h1 in the header correctly contains "FTS Productions" rather than the page name.</li>
                <li><strong>Main Content:</strong> The main section properly starts with the page name "Welcome to From the Stage Productions" as an h2.</li>
                <li><strong>Footer:</strong> The footer contains validation buttons for HTML and CSS but there are not navigation links.</li>
                <li><strong>HTML Validation:</strong> The HTML validation button works and the page validates without errors.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS Validation:</strong> The CSS validation button works and the does not validate without errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Design & Usability (CRAP Principles)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Font sizing is appropriate throughout the site and the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool shows no contrast errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Colors, fonts, and spacing are used consistently throughout the site, creating a cohesive design.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are properly aligned and organized with good overall structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is grouped together logically with appropriate spacing.</li>
                <li><strong>Overall Design:</strong> The color and other CSS choices are visually appealing and fit the film aesthetic well.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Client Project Pt. 2 Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimum 5 Pages:</strong> The site includes 5 pages as required, though several pages are missing content.</li>
                <li><strong>Separate Files:</strong> CSS is properly separated into external files. However, there is no JavaScript implementation at all.</li>
                <li><strong>Index.html Home Page:</strong> The home page uses proper structure with header, main, and footer elements with appropriate use of ids and classes.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistent Navigation:</strong> A working navigation bar is present on all pages in the same position.</li>
                <li><strong>Content Requirements:</strong> While the pages have appropriate names, three pages contain image placeholders rather than actual content, which needs to be completed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Additional Observations</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Good:</strong> The color choice for the page fits the film aesthetic very well and creates an appropriate mood. The layout of the galleries is visually appealing and well-organized. The FTS Productions logos are very cool and professionally designed.</li>
                <li><strong>The Bad:</strong> The footer is very bare and could benefit from including contact information and social media links for easy access. The navigation buttons at the top could be customized to better fit the film aesthetic rather than using default styling.</li>
                <li><strong>The Ugly:</strong> The site needs actual images to replace placeholders and more interactivity throughout the pages to engage visitors.</li>
                <li><strong>Suggestions:</strong> Consider making the margins for the body text a little wider, as they are currently very narrow and could affect readability.</li>
                <li><strong>Continue:</strong> The colors of the page are great and have no contrast errors when used correctly—maintain this color palette.</li>
                <li><strong>Start:</strong> Adding a portfolio/showcase section with video embeds or trailers of completed projects, and implementing smooth scroll animations or transitions to enhance the cinematic feel of the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Replace place holder images with actual content as soon as possible to make the site feel complete and professional.</li>
            </ul>
